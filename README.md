# Project-Easy-Rider-Bus-Company

The work seemed tedious and endless, but it finally looks like we're getting there. There is only one more point left in the specification that we need to check and fix: on-demand stops cannot be initial, final, or transfer stops.

The string containing the data in JSON format is passed to standard input.
Check that all the departure points, final stops, and transfer stations are not "On-demand".
Display the unique names of the stops containing this type of issue. Sort them in ascending order.
If everything is fine, print OK.
The output should have the same formatting as shown in the example.
